Jamie Christopherson – Collective Consciousness

[Verse 1A]
The unenlightened masses
They cannot make the judgement call
Give up free will forever
Their voices won’t be heard at all

Display obedience
While never stepping out of line
And blindly swear allegiance
Let your country control your mind
(Let your country control your soul)
[Verse 1B]
Live in ignorance
And purchase your happiness
When blood and sweat is the real cost
Thinking ceases, the truth is lost
Don’t you worry
You’ll be told exactly what to do
I give my people the lives they need
The righteous will succeed

[Verse 2]
The fires of greed will burn the weak
So we’ll make freedom obsolete
Making whole the fabric of society
Collective consciousness controlled as you will see

(Mind control)

[Bridge]
(Let your country control your soul)
(Let your country control your soul)
(Let your country control your soul)
(Let your country control your soul...)
